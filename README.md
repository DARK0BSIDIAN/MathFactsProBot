# MathFactsProBot

~~### Only Setup to work with mutipliction
it can be changed/added to, note that symbols used in mathfactspro strings of questions are NOT Standard x, -, + on the keyboard, copy and paste them or you will get an error!~~

## Has compatibilty for other sets now
But seems that github made a boo boo with the code so it needs some EMS.


### Setup
install nodejs
open cmd in the working directory and type 'npm i'
edit the index.js and change the teacher, username, and password
then node index.js
